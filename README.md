**Lead Software Engineer · Technical Architect**  
Ireland 🇮🇪

I’m a software engineer who enjoys building systems and helping people build them well.

My work focuses on **software architecture, technical leadership, and delivery**. I’ve led engineering teams, shaped technical direction on large projects, and worked on production systems across startups and Fortune 500 organisations. I care about clarity, but I also care about curiosity, learning, and leaving space for new ideas.

## What I Work On

- Leading and mentoring engineering teams (around 30 developers)
- Designing scalable, maintainable, cloud-native systems
- Turning unclear problem spaces into shared technical direction
- Making architectural decisions through discussion and collaboration
- Creating environments where engineers can experiment safely and learn

I value creativity in problem solving, especially when it’s supported by clear goals and shared understanding.

## Selected Experience

- **Lead Engineer / Technical Lead** on a Fortune 500 project, responsible for architecture, technical direction, and delivery
- Experience across **startups and established organisations**, from early product work to large-scale system evolution
- Published and presented a peer-reviewed technical paper in Japan
- Comfortable working across frontend, backend, and infrastructure concerns

## Research Interests

My professional work increasingly overlaps with academic research, particularly around how developers think about software systems and their failures.

Current areas of interest include:

- **Software defect classification**  
  How defects are defined and categorised differently across organisations, and how clearer, shared frameworks could improve communication, prioritisation, and tooling.

- **Ambiguity in software engineering**  
  How developers interpret requirements, defects, and failures when information is incomplete or unclear, and how context and experience shape those interpretations.

- **AI-assisted software development**  
  How developers interact with AI coding assistants, and what those interactions can tell us about things like stress, confidence, and uncertainty.

- **Living systematic literature reviews**  
  Using automation and AI tools to keep literature reviews up to date as new research is published.

## Publications

**Spatial Maths: A Library for Conveying Content and Structure of Equations**  
Presented at DEIMS, Japan

## Technical Stack

**Languages & Frameworks**  
JavaScript · TypeScript · Python · C#  
React · Node.js

**Data & Infrastructure**  
PostgreSQL · MySQL  
AWS · Serverless · Docker

**General**  
Git · CI/CD · Cloud-native architectures

I tend to choose tools that make systems easier to understand, change, and explain to others.

## Outside Work

I run regularly and enjoy systems that reward patience, learning, and steady improvement.  
This applies equally to software, research, and games that don’t hand you easy answers.
